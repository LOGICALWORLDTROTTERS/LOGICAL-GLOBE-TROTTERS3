# LOGICAL-GLOBE-TROTTERS3
Description As a developing nation and as one of the most populous country in the world, we in India face unique problems that require a unique solution such problem is that of waste management.  The Mission of Our Projects is to keep the areas and infrastructure of the country clean, so that to present this country as an ideal country before the world.   In the existing systems no proper planning regarding distinguish the garbage as biodegradable and non-biodegradable due to some problems which makes the city or town unhygienic.  Only traditional and manual garbage system is available.  No automatic or technology orientated system exist.  This project is design for the effective garbage classification using artificial intelligence.  In this method, whenever the garbage is dumped, it will automatically split up the garbage as Biodegradable and Non-Biodegradable in trash bin. In our project,first AI detects whether it is trash or not. If it is a trash,then the trash bin automatically take the trash from outside. If the trash is smaller one, then we can use vacuum cleaner. Then the AI classify the trash as biodegradable and Non biodegradable. If we have more time , we can also do the following idea. The idea is , we can collect the waste vegetables and fruits in the trash bin., we can convert it into a valuable fertilizer in the trash bin.
